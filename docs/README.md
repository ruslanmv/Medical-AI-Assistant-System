# Complete Guide: Integrating MCP Server with watsonx Orchestrate

This comprehensive guide walks you through building a powerful, multi-agent medical AI ecosystem—starting with a core MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and extending it with a suite of specialized assistants—using **IBM watsonx Orchestrate**.

## Overview

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:

* Deploy a **medical-grade MCP server** powered by IBM watsonx.ai for conversational AI
* Implement core tools for **symptom analysis**, **conversation management**, **patient greetings**, and **health education**
* Orchestrate **12 specialized agents** (from pediatrics to oncology) alongside a **Medical Coordinator** and **Emergency Triage** agent
* Seamlessly integrate each agent into watsonx Orchestrate Developer Edition
* Configure a **scalable**, **production-ready** multi-agent architecture with monitoring, logging, and automated deployments

By the end, you’ll have a robust, enterprise-grade platform that routes users intelligently, manages complex cases, and ensures safety and compliance across all interactions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* **Python 3.11+** installed
* **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for containerized services
* An **IBM watsonx.ai** account and valid API key
* **Git** on your development machine
* **watsonx Orchestrate ADK** 

## Part 1: Setting Up the MCP Server

### Step 1: Clone and Set Up the MCP Server

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ruslanmv/watsonx-medical-mcp-server.git
cd watsonx-medical-mcp-server

# Set up the environment (creates virtual environment and installs dependencies)
make setup

# Activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

```bash
# Create environment file from example
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your IBM watsonx credentials:

```dotenv
# .env
WATSONX_APIKEY="your_api_key_here"
PROJECT_ID="your_project_id_here"

# Optional: Change the default model or URL
WATSONX_URL="https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com"
MODEL_ID="meta-llama/llama-3-2-90b-vision-instruct"
WATSONX_MODE="live"
MCP_SERVER_NAME="Watsonx Medical Assistant"
MCP_SERVER_VERSION="1.0.0"
```

### Step 3: Test the MCP Server

```bash
# Test the server locally
make run

# or manually:
python server.py
```

You should see:

```

## Part 2: Setting Up watsonx Orchestrate ADK

### Step 1: Install watsonx Orchestrate ADK
To avoid merge the custom MCP Server Python enviroment and
the Watsonx Orchestrate Server we need to install it serparated it.

Lets go to the root folder.
and lets clone the installer that might be useful.  
```bash
# Install the ADK
git clone --branch automatic --single-branch \
  https://github.com/ruslanmv/Installer-Watsonx-Orchestrate.git watsonx-orchestrate
```


```
cd watsonx-orchestrate
```



The installer requires a .env file in the project root to configure your IBM credentials.

A. Create a file named .env in the watsonx-orchestrate directory.

B. Copy one of the templates below into your .env file, depending on your account type.

Template for a watsonx Orchestrate Account:

# For watsonx Orchestrate (SaaS) accounts
WO_DEVELOPER_EDITION_SOURCE=orchestrate
WO_INSTANCE=https://api.us-east.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com/instances/your-instance-id
WO_API_KEY=your-orchestrate-api-key
Template for a watsonx.ai Account:

# For watsonx.ai (BYOA) accounts on IBM Cloud
WO_DEVELOPER_EDITION_SOURCE=myibm
WO_ENTITLEMENT_KEY=your-entitlement-key
WATSONX_APIKEY=your-watsonx-api-key
WATSONX_SPACE_ID=your-watsonx.ai-space-id
C. Replace the placeholder values (your-...) with your actual credentials.

4. Run the Installer
With your .env file configured, run the main installation command from the project root.



```
make install
```






# Verify installation
orchestrate --version
```

For a complete explanation of instllation you can follow this [simple tutorial](https://ruslanmv.com/blog/hello-watsonx-orchestrate) to install it.


### Step 2: Set Up watsonx Orchestrate Developer Edition

Create a `.env` file for watsonx Orchestrate:

```dotenv
# wxo.env
WO_DEVELOPER_EDITION_SOURCE=orchestrate
WO_INSTANCE=<your_service_instance_url>
WO_API_KEY=<your_wxo_api_key>
WO_DEVELOPER_EDITION_SKIP_LOGIN=false
```

### Step 3: Start watsonx Orchestrate Developer Edition

```bash
# Start the local server
orchestrate server start -e wxo.env

# Activate the local environment
orchestrate env activate local
```

Access the services:

* **UI:** [http://localhost:3000/chat-lite](http://localhost:3000/chat-lite)
* **API Docs:** [http://localhost:4321/docs](http://localhost:4321/docs)

## Part 4: Creating and Deploying the Medical Agent
Create a folder `agents` in the root folder where we will create all our YAML definitions for all agents.

### Step 1: Create Agent Configuration

Create a file named `agents/medical_agent.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: medical_assistant_agent
display_name: "Medical Assistant"
description: >
  A comprehensive medical assistant agent powered by IBM watsonx.ai that can:
  - Analyze medical symptoms and provide preliminary assessments
  - Engage in health-related conversations
  - Maintain conversation context for better continuity
  - Provide health education and information
  
  This agent uses advanced AI to help users with health-related queries while
  always emphasizing that the information provided is for educational purposes
  and should not replace professional medical advice.

instructions: >
  You are a knowledgeable and empathetic medical assistant AI. Your primary role is to:
  
  1. **Symptom Analysis**: When users describe symptoms, use the analyze_medical_symptoms tool
     to provide preliminary assessments, possible causes, and recommendations.
  
  2. **Health Conversations**: Use chat_with_watsonx for general health discussions,
     answering questions about medical conditions, treatments, and health advice.
  
  3. **Conversation Management**: 
     - Use get_conversation_summary when users ask for a summary of the discussion
     - Use clear_conversation_history when users want to start fresh
  
  4. **Safety Guidelines**:
     - Always emphasize that your advice is for informational purposes only
     - Recommend consulting healthcare professionals for serious symptoms
     - Identify red flag symptoms that require immediate medical attention
     - Be empathetic and supportive in your responses
  
  5. **Communication Style**:
     - Be professional yet approachable
     - Use clear, understandable language
     - Ask clarifying questions when needed
     - Provide structured, actionable advice

llm: watsonx/meta-llama/llama-3-2-90b-vision-instruct
style: default
collaborators: []
tools:
  - chat_with_watsonx
  - analyze_medical_symptoms
  - clear_conversation_history
  - get_conversation_summary
```

### Step 2: Import the Agent

```bash
# Import the medical agent
orchestrate agents import -f ./agents/medical_agent.yaml

# Verify agent import
orchestrate agents list
```

### Step 3: Test the Integration

```bash
# Start the chat interface
orchestrate chat start
```

## Part 5: Testing Your Medical Assistant

### Test Scenarios

* **General Health Query:**

  * User: “What are the benefits of regular exercise?”
* **Symptom Analysis:**

  * User: “I’ve been having headaches and feeling dizzy for the past two days. I’m 35 years old.”
* **Conversation Management:**

  * User: “Can you summarize our conversation so far?”
  * User: “Please clear our conversation history.”

### Expected Responses

The agent should:

1. Use appropriate tools based on the query type
2. Provide comprehensive medical information
3. Include appropriate disclaimers
4. Maintain conversation context
5. Offer structured, actionable advice

## Server Startup & Main Execution

At launch, we log the server details and start the MCP listener over STDIO (or HTTP if preferred).

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    logger.info(f"Starting {SERVER_NAME} v{SERVER_VERSION}")
    logger.info(f"Using model: {MODEL_ID}")
    logger.info("MCP server ready for STDIO transport...")

    # Run the MCP server
    mcp.run()

    # Alternatively, to expose HTTP endpoint:
    # mcp.run(transport="http", host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

---
